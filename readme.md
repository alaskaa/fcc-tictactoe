## Tic - Tac - Toe Game

This is my implementation of the penultimate freeCodeCamp challenge for the Front End Development Certification.

This game contains a human and an AI player that play the famous Tic-Tac-Toe Game against each other.

More specifically, the game will implement the Minimax algorithm.
